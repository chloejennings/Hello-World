# Hello-World
My first repository on GitHub.
My name is Chloe Jennings, I am a junior studying Media and Information with a specialization in Design. From St. Clair Shores, MI. I currently work for The Center for Spartan Engineers as their one man design team! (It's stressful but it's fun). Some hobbies that I do include: teaching myself how to shoot film (just bought 6 vintage film cameras at an antique store for $20 and I'm so pumped), staying up will 3am watercolor painting, reading (currently: The Great Gatsby), watching movies, and stalking tumblr. I live in a coop with 23 other people called Orion. I'm a pescetarian (vegitarian that eats fish). When I graduate college I am moving out west, preferably Oregon (I love trees) and I hope to work for a small design/marketing business. I am interested in graphics, motion graphics, web design, mobile design, and branding.
